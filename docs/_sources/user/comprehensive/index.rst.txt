The QDK Chemistry library is designed to facilitate quantum chemistry calculations and simulations. It
provides a set of tools and libraries for working with molecular structures, performing electronic structure
calculations, and analyzing quantum many-body systems.

QDK/Chemistry features a unified interface for communitry quantum chemistry software packages,
allowing seamless interoperability with established software while maintaining a consistent API. This enables users to
leverage specialized capabilities across different packages without changing their workflow.
