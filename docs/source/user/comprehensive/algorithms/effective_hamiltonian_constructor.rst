Effective Hamiltonian construction
==================================

The :class:`~qdk_chemistry.algorithms.EffectiveHamiltonianConstructor` algorithm in QDK/Chemistry defines a common interface for downfolding a Hamiltonian from a larger orbital window into a smaller target space.
Following QDK/Chemistry's :doc:`algorithm design principles <../design/index>`, it takes a reference :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Wavefunction`, an input :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Hamiltonian`, and target-space orbital indices as input and produces an effective :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Hamiltonian` as output.
The interface leaves the downfolding approximation and method-specific diagnostics to the concrete implementation.

Overview
--------

Let the orbital window :math:`W` be partitioned into a target space :math:`P` and an external space :math:`Q`:

.. math::

   W = P \cup Q,
   \qquad
   P \cap Q = \varnothing.

Using :math:`\hat P` and :math:`\hat Q` for the corresponding projectors, the full-window Hamiltonian has the block structure

.. math::

   H_W =
   \begin{pmatrix}
      H_{PP} & H_{PQ} \\
      H_{QP} & H_{QQ}
   \end{pmatrix},
   \qquad
   H_{PP} = \hat P H_W \hat P.

An implementation accounts for the influence of :math:`Q` while constructing an effective Hamiltonian that acts only in :math:`P`:

.. math::

   \mathcal{D}\!\left(\lvert \Psi_{\mathrm{ref}} \rangle, H_W, P\right)
   = H_{\mathrm{eff}}^{P},
   \qquad
   H_{\mathrm{eff}}^{P} = \hat P H_{\mathrm{eff}}^{P} \hat P,

where :math:`\mathcal{D}` denotes the selected downfolding implementation.
The interface does not prescribe how the coupling blocks :math:`H_{PQ}` and :math:`H_{QP}` or the external block :math:`H_{QQ}` contribute to :math:`H_{\mathrm{eff}}^{P}`.

Using the EffectiveHamiltonianConstructor
-----------------------------------------

The ``run`` method takes a reference wavefunction, a full-window Hamiltonian, the target-space indices, and optionally a collection of auxiliary bases, and returns the effective Hamiltonian acting in :math:`P`.

Input requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`~qdk_chemistry.algorithms.EffectiveHamiltonianConstructor` requires the following inputs:

Reference wavefunction
   A :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Wavefunction` that defines the reference state used by the downfolding method.

Input Hamiltonian
   A :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Hamiltonian` expressed over the complete orbital window :math:`W`.

Target-space indices
   A :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.symmetry.SymmetryBlockedIndexSet` containing the indices of :math:`P`.
   These are absolute molecular-orbital indices, drawn from the same index universe as ``Orbitals.active_indices()``, and must lie within the active space of :math:`W`.

Auxiliary bases (optional)
   An :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.AuxiliaryBasisCollection` carrying the secondary Gaussian bases a method may need, such as the complementary auxiliary basis set (CABS) of an explicitly correlated method.
   Implementations that do not need one ignore this argument.

Output contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The returned :class:`~qdk_chemistry.data.Hamiltonian` is expressed over :math:`P` and satisfies:

- its orbitals have ``active_indices()`` equal to the requested target-space indices;
- its orbitals classify fully occupied orbitals of :math:`Q = W \setminus P` as inactive and unoccupied orbitals of :math:`Q` as virtual, while preserving the input Hamiltonian's inactive orbitals;
- its inactive Fock matrix, when present, is consistent with the output inactive orbitals and may therefore differ from the input Hamiltonian's inactive Fock matrix;
- the scalar shift from folding in :math:`Q` is added to the constant (zero-body) energy term, and the remaining :math:`Q` contribution is folded into the integrals.

The occupied/virtual partition of :math:`Q` is method dependent and is determined by the concrete implementation from its reference state.
Classifying an orbital of :math:`Q` as virtual describes its occupation in the output orbital metadata; it does not place that orbital in the effective active space.
Consumers of an effective Hamiltonian should not attempt to re-correlate :math:`Q`, since its contribution is already folded in.

Input validation is opt-in.
The ``run`` method does not validate its arguments; each concrete implementation decides whether to check the space contract :math:`P \subseteq W_H` and :math:`W_{\mathrm{ref}} \subseteq W_H` before computing.

The base interface defines no common settings.
Concrete implementations can expose method-specific configuration through the ``settings()`` object.
See :doc:`Settings <settings>` for a general treatment of algorithm settings in QDK/Chemistry.

Available implementations
-------------------------

QDK/Chemistry provides :class:`~qdk_chemistry.algorithms.QdkCtF12HamiltonianConstructor` (``"qdk_ct_f12"``), the default choice for this algorithm type.
It applies an approximate canonical (unitary) similarity transformation of the molecular Hamiltonian with a fixed-amplitude Slater-type geminal generator, producing an a priori Hermitian two-body effective Hamiltonian over :math:`P`.
Its complementary auxiliary basis (CABS) is the external space the transformation folds in, so it is required: pass it as the ``AuxiliaryBasisRole.CABS`` entry of ``auxiliary_bases``.
Its ``frozen_core`` setting is independent of ``p_indices``: it selects which electrons are correlated at the F12 level, whereas ``p_indices`` selects which orbitals the emitted Hamiltonian acts on.
The Slater exponent ``gamma`` defaults to ``1.0`` and must satisfy ``0 < gamma <= 100``.
The example below sets ``gamma=1.5`` explicitly because that value is used by the published neon CT-F12 benchmarks.

.. code-block:: python

    import qdk_chemistry.algorithms as alg
    from qdk_chemistry.data import AuxiliaryBasis, AuxiliaryBasisCollection, AuxiliaryBasisRole

    cabs = AuxiliaryBasisCollection(
        {AuxiliaryBasisRole.CABS: AuxiliaryBasis.from_basis_name("aug-cc-pvdz-optri", structure)}
    )
    constructor = alg.create("effective_hamiltonian_constructor", gamma=1.5, frozen_core=1)
    dressed = constructor.run(reference, hamiltonian, p_indices, cabs)
