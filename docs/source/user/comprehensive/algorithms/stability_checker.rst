Stability analysis
==================

Stability analysis :cite:`Schlegel1991` is a crucial step in self-consistent field (:term:`SCF`) calculations to ensure that the obtained solution corresponds to a true energy minimum rather than a saddle point or maximum. Unstable solutions can lead to inaccurate results in subsequent calculations, such as correlation methods or excited state computations.

.. note::

   The :term:`SCF` stability checks documentation is currently under construction.
   In the meantime, please refer to :class:`qdk_chemistry.algorithms.StabilityChecker` for more information.
