Python API
==========

This section provides complete documentation for the QDK/Chemistry Python API.

QDK/Chemistry provides Python interfaces for quantum chemistry calculations with a unified API.
The Python interface offers a user-friendly way to set up, run, and analyze quantum chemistry calculations without requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying implementation details.

API Reference
=============

Data Classes
------------

The data classes provide fundamental structures for representing quantum chemistry concepts such as molecular structures, electronic states, and computational results.
These classes handle the storage, manipulation, and exchange of quantum chemistry data throughout the QDK/Chemistry ecosystem.

For detailed information, see :doc:`api_autogen/chemistry.data`.

Algorithms
----------

The algorithms module contains implementations of various quantum chemistry methods and computational techniques.
This includes electronic structure methods, post-Hartree-Fock correlation methods, and other advanced computational approaches for studying molecular systems and their properties.

For detailed information, see :doc:`api_autogen/chemistry.algorithms`.

Constants
---------

The constants module provides access to fundamental physical constants, conversion factors, and reference values frequently used in quantum chemistry calculations.
These constants ensure consistency and accuracy throughout all computational procedures.

For detailed information, see :doc:`api_autogen/chemistry.constants`.

Plugins
-------

The plugins module offers extensions and integrations with other quantum chemistry software packages and computational tools.
These plugins allow QDK/Chemistry to leverage functionality from other established quantum chemistry codes and expand its capabilities.

For detailed information, see :doc:`api_autogen/chemistry.plugins`.
